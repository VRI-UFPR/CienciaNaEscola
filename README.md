### Introduction

   In elementary schools in Brazil, the study method is often monotonous since there is no means to learn in a fun and more interactive way, distancing the relationship between student and teacher. This bland study method makes learning difficult since if the practice of teaching isn't fun, it's harder for students to focus, and they tend to get less knowledge. As the main objective of the Science at School project, we have the dissemination of science within elementary schools, thus bringing a diversified project of teacher evaluation methods, in which we will create forms of evaluation from the simplest to the most complex. According to the 2021 FGV survey1, Brazil has 440 million digital devices in use (computers, notebooks, tablets, and smartphones), approximately two devices per inhabitant. Knowing this, the group aims to create a project including a smartphone app for interacting and answering protocols and a dashboard for the teacher, or pedagogical supervisor (who will have a higher position within the platform) to create, remove and edit protocols. These protocols may include practical activities, such as taking photos and recording videos, or several academic activities, such as writing a text or an objective multiple-choice question.

### Forms

   Forms are chained sequences of statements and answers. These forms are going to be used by students to execute a protocol. A teacher and researcher have access to and permission to create, edit and delete the form components.

   The forms contain one kind of components indicating for the user what to do, how to do it, and what must be delivered. Prologue and epilogue are mandatory components of this kind. The forms have also another kind of components for students to fill in and respond to what was requested.
